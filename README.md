# Memory-Management-System-Project-

A memory management system is a crucial part of an operating system that handles the efficient allocation, tracking, and deallocation of memory resources for running applications. Its goal is to ensure that memory is used effectively, securely, and without conflicts between processes.

✨ Key Functions:
Allocation: Assigns portions of memory to different programs and processes when requested.

Deallocation: Frees up memory when it's no longer needed or when a process terminates.

Tracking: Keeps tabs on which parts of memory are in use and by whom.

Protection: Prevents processes from accessing each other’s memory, safeguarding system stability and security.
